A viscous fluid of moss green coloration with the smell of rotten mint. Used for Insight or Resonate rituals of characters. Also used as the material for crafting advanced materials.

_You trembled in your dreams and suddenly woke up with a scream. They were running across your skin. Made with cracked teeth, the liquefaction has improved its stability and shelf life. Tasting it is not recommended as it brings more than just nightmares._
