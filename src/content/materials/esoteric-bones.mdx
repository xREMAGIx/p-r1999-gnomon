A rather intact set of bones but the pieces are taken from different animals. Used for Insight or Resonate rituals of characters. Also used as the material for crafting advanced materials.

_Though not as superior as a full skeleton, the femur, ribs, and pieces of the skull are the optimal solution you can afford._
