2 Energy to activate: (0/2) 

After taking an action, each Disk held grants a **60%** chance to gain 2 stacks of :effect{code="DYNAMO"}. If all allies gain a total of 5 or more stacks of :effect{code="DYNAMO"} in a round, inflict :effect{code="ELECTROCUTE"} on all enemies 1 time based on the ATK of the ally with the highest ATK.
