When triggering Incantation Resonance, **50%** chance to grant :effect{code="EMPOWER_INCANTATION_I"} and :effect{code="ANTICIPATION_SUPPORT_I"} to a random ally for 1 round. When a non-Support artefact is within range, gain :effect{code="EMPOWER_INCANTATION_II"} and :effect{code="ANTICIPATION_SUPPORT_II"} instead.
