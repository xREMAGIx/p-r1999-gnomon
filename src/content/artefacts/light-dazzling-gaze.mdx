After being attacked, gain 5 stacks of :effect{code="CEREMONIOUS"}. After allies lose 100 stacks of :effect{code="CEREMONIOUS"} in total, all allies gain 5 stacks of :effect{code="REGEN"} and 1 stack of :effect{code="MORIBUND"}. (Unique artefact, cannot be copied or stored). When 2 or more Ritual artefacts are within range, the number of :effect{code="CEREMONIOUS"} stacks that must be lost is reduced by 50.
