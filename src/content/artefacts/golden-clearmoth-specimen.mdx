After casting an Ultimate, increase Incantation Syntony level by 1 if Incantation Syntony is triggered on the next round. When Incantation Syntony reaches Lv.5, all allies gain 1 stack of :effect{code="INCORPOREAL"}. When 4 or more Syntony artefacts are within range and when an ally casts an ultimate, further increase Incantation Syntony level by 1 if Incantation Syntony is triggered on the next round.
