When triggering Incantation Resonance, all allies gain 1 stack of :effect{code="THORNY"} and obtain 5 Goldfinch Coins. When an ally casts a rank 2/3 incantation, they gain 2 stacks of :effect{code="THORNY"} and obtain 5 Goldfinch Coins. When a non-Resonance artefact is within range and if an Incantation Resonance is triggered, obtain 5 additional Goldfinch Coins.
